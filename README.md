# Flat-File-to-BigQuery
This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python and Pandas. The workflow begins by extracting a CSV file (bank transaction data), performing basic data inspection using Pandas, and loading the cleaned data into Google BigQuery for further analysis.
